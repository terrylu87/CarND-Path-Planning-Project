### My Model
I use the start code described in project walkthrough. PathPlanner is the class who do all the jobs.
3 States are defined for handle the highway situation. FOLLOW_IN_LANE,PREPARE_LANE_CHANGE,CHANGE_LANE.
The transaction table is defined as follow:

| State t \\ State t+1 | FOLLOW_IN_LANE       | PREPARE_LANE_CHANGE                             | CHANGE_LANE      |
| -------------        | -------------        | -------------                                   | -------------    |
| FOLLOW_IN_LANE       | N                    | slow_vehicle_in_front && there_is_a_faster_lane | N                |
| PREPARE_LANE_CHANGE  | N                    | N                                               | target_lane_safe |
| CHANGE_LANE          | change_lane_complete | N                                               | N                |

There are 4 stimulations : slow_vehicle_in_front, there_is_a_faster_lane, target_lane_safe, change_lane_complete.

Those stimulations are generated by checking the sensor_fusion data. (path_planner.cpp:90). 

Since the cars in simulator drive in a very stedy way. I just check their distance from our car to judge whether it is safe to change the lane.

The speed of each lane is defined as the slowest car in that lane, with in my preception distance. The fastest lane is a good candidate for the potential lane changes.

Next step is to create new state based on those conditions. (path_planner.cpp:169).

Once the beheaviour is decided, the trajectories are generated using the method described in walkthrough video.(path_planner.cpp:227)

The simple model is able to ran servral times without accident.
